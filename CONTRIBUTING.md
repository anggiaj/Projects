How to Contribute
==================

## Solutions

Please do send pull requests for replacing my code.

=====================================

## Projects

If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects/issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the *README.md* file with necessary changes. If you add a problem, make sure you add it in the correct category.

It is required that any changes made to the projects (this does not include adding solutions) in *README.md*, must be reflected in *README-scratch.md*, in *README.md* file in the relevant category folder, and in the [Solutions *README.md* file](https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects-Solutions/blob/master/README.md)

If you're copying a project from some other webpage, you **MUST** link to it in the *Sources* section at the bottom of repo's *README.md* and *README-scratch.md*.

If you skip any step(s), I will not merge the changes!
